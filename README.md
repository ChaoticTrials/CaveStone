**CaveStone** is a Modpack that you have never seen before! Or did you?

![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MelanX/ModDescriptions/HEAD/assets/modpacks/cavestone/overview.png)

You may be familiar with the concept of the pack but without being familiar with it at all. You'll land in a world filled with stone. Sounds like Stoneblock, I know, I know... But wait for the additional features!

You will not have a mod for resources at the beginning, you need to dig for your resources. This modpack aims to be very vanilla. There are a few mods, but no big tech mods. Ores do generate in the world. Some structures do generate in the world.

The quests were added by [Heracles](https://modrinth.com/mod/heracles) which can be accessed by pressing U by default.

This pack isn't fully done yet. If you’re updating to a newer minor version (e.g. 0.4.0), it could cause world generation issues. These updates recommend a fresh world. That’s why the official server will be reset each time a new minor version is released. Most of the time, newly generated chunks should work just fine. If I only change very minor things like the vein size of a generated ore, this will not cause a new minor release, only a new patch release (e.g. x.x.5). And as always: read the changelog, it could include important information.

Here, you can see one of the 3 possible spawns:

That is the default spawn cave. Two other versions add more initial blocks. You'll spawn with a custom wooden pickaxe and maybe... you'll find a treasure nearby? *you need to create your own team by using `/skyblock gui` or pressing L (default)*

Come, dive into a world full of stone!

German, but just writing in English is fine)!
